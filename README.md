# PHP array :approximate a PHP array using Java
To implement a hybrid Symbol Table that provides hash table access, indexed integer access, and sequential access
The PHP language has an interesting array data type.  Rather than a simple array like that of C or Java, the PHP array is a hybrid of a hash table and a linked list.  This allows for a lot of functionality, including hash table access, indexed integer access, and sequential access (via the linked list)
